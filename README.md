Rate My Professor App

Project Overview
RateMyProfessors is an online rating platform designed for college students to share and rate their experiences with professors to help their fellow students to have a better learning experience throughout college. The problem we’ve encountered when we tried to use the platform is that It is mainly used by universities in North America and Europe thus we’ve felt the need for a localized version of the application to be used in Sabancı University.

Objective and Scope of the project
We are offering an enhanced learning experience to our fellow Sabancı students by giving them a platform to share their experiences and benefit from other students' experiences to make more informed decisions while choosing their professors.

To achieve this goal we are planning on using mainly 4 endpoints:

1-	User Identification Endpoint : It’ll be used in login and creating new user operations and authentication of the users when they enter their login info.
2-	Professor Information Endpoint: It’ll be used to gather information about the professors from the Sabancı database to be used in the application.
3-	Student Information Endpoint: It’ll be used to reach the student profile.
4-	Searching Endpoints: It’ll be used to find the information about a specific professor or a class.

Our program will contain 6 screens which are:

1-	Login Screen
2-	Main Screen: It includes a search bar and the latest reviews done by students.
3-	Professor Profile: Including the professor's rating, comments about them and the classes they teach or used to be teaching.
4-	Class Information: Shows which professors are currently teaching the class and their ratings.
5-	Review Submission: It’ll be used to rate and leave a comment about a professor and in which class the student had this experience.
6-	User Profile: It shows the reviews and general information about the student.

Background and current practice
As we’ve mentioned previously, there is currently an app that is serving the same purpose. Our application is a localized version of a currently existing application.

Potential customer/user description
Our target audience is Sabancı University students as it is designed to be used only by our school’s students; however, if there is sufficient demand we’d be open to expanding the scope to universities in major cities such as Istanbul, Ankara or Izmir and eventually with enough demand scope could be increased to countrywide access.
