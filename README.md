Rate My Professor App

Project Overview
RateMyProfessors is an online rating platform designed for college students to share and rate their experiences with professors to help their fellow students to have a better learning experience throughout college. The problem we’ve encountered when we tried to use the platform is that It is mainly used by universities in North America and Europe thus we’ve felt the need for a localized version of the application to be used in Sabancı University.

Objective and Scope of the project
We are offering an enhanced learning experience to our fellow Sabancı students by giving them a platform to share their experiences and benefit from other students' experiences to make more informed decisions while choosing their professors.
